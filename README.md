# Library Occupancy
This repository contains an Android application for LibraryOccupancyApp. The application was assigned during winter 2016 as a final project in CSE 455, Software Engineering.

The application shows the current occupancy of the library using a sensor device built in Android. Also, it provides a view histogram of total occupancy over the previous 7 days, which displays the total occupancy of each day and the highest and lowest occupancy of the week.
